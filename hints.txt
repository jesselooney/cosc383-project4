To revert hex into executable file:
xxd -r -p hexnumbers.txt > backtoexec.txt


Roses are red,
Black roses are black,
Now add the right nodes
To get the message back.

P.S. I tried encrypting my favorite color with the graph to test it.
I jot down the node values somewhere, but I can't find it anymore...

Pr0hax0r's favorite color is encrypted with the graph key. If it is red, green, or blue, then maybe we can deduce their favorite pokemon.
