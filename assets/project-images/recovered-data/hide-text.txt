How the Telepathy Magic Trick is done:

It may behoove the reader to first understand Freud's model concerning the Id, Ego, and Superego.
In addition, a deep understanding of the fast Fourier transform as applied to sound waves may help in understanding (although perhaps not being able to perform) the trick.
Finally, a background in the techniques commonly used by Tuvan throat singers may be helfpul.

First a volunteer is called for by the magician.
The rest is all a bit fuzzy.

A more detailed description can be found hidden in the final project.
Happy hunting!
